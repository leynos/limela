# Limela ✨

> **isiLimela** — the Zulu name for the Pleiades, the constellation that signals the time of planting and renewal in Bantu cultures.

Limela finds the constellations in your emails, bringing order to your world.

## What is Limela?

Limela is an email intelligence pipeline that transforms your chaotic inbox into a structured knowledge graph. It reads your emails, understands their meaning, discovers patterns and conversations, and helps you see the bigger picture — the constellations hidden in your daily communication.

Think of it as an astronomer for your inbox: while you see individual stars (emails), Limela reveals the constellations (topics, threads, relationships) that connect them.

## Current Status: Work in Progress 🚧

Limela is in active development. We have comprehensive architectural plans and are building the foundation. Check out [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) to see where we're headed.

## The Vision: Five Stages to Clarity

Limela processes emails through a sophisticated pipeline:

1. **Normalization** — Parse MIME structures, extract headers, handle attachments
2. **Purification** — Convert HTML to clean text, remove noise (signatures, disclaimers, reply chains)
3. **Meta-Embedding** — Generate semantic representations using transformer models (SBERT + ColBERT)
4. **Clustering** — Discover thematic groups and conversation threads automatically using density-based clustering
5. **Knowledge Graph** — Build a queryable graph of people, topics, threads, and their relationships

The result? Your emails become a navigable constellation map, with patterns and connections revealed.

## Features (Planned)

- **High-performance processing** — Written in Rust for speed and reliability
- **Privacy-focused** — Stores only metadata and encrypted pointers, not email bodies
- **IMAP integration** — Tag emails in your existing mail client based on discovered clusters
- **Semantic search** — Find emails by meaning, not just keywords
- **Conversation threading** — Automatic discovery of related emails across time and topics
- **Streaming updates** — Real-time processing as new emails arrive

## Getting Started (For Developers)

Limela requires Rust (Edition 2024) and uses a strict code quality standard.

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (1.80+)
- Make (for convenience commands)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Build the project
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Check code quality
make lint

# Format code
make fmt
```

For detailed development guidelines and coding standards, see the documentation in the `docs/` directory.

## Why Limela?

Email is one of our most valuable knowledge sources, but it's trapped in chronological chaos. We scan the same threads repeatedly, lose track of important conversations, and struggle to see patterns across time.

Limela brings the power of modern NLP, graph theory, and clustering algorithms to your inbox — helping you work with your email as a knowledge base, not a to-do list.

The constellations have always been there. Limela helps you see them.
